First assignment: Selenuim Webdriver based UI test 

        I have used Junit testing as a test script and as mentioned Selenium Webdriver as a test harness. 
        
        This test would run on firefox browser. Please download Firefox and Eclipse to run this file. 
        All the test case is present in BaseTest.java File. 
        
   To run: 
   
1) Change the working directory of the driver on launchBrowserAndNavigateToURL() method on BaseTest.java file. 
2) Click on run and the test would start. 




Second assignment: API request test 

   I used python3 script to do the API endpoint testing and the API testing can be found in simrequest.py file. 

  To run :
    this file make sure you have installed requests library i.e. pip install requests 
     then run python3 simrequest.py
